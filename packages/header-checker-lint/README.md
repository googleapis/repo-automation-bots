# header-checker-lint

> A GitHub App built with [Probot][probot] that ensures source files contain a
valid license header.

## Installation

You can install this bot [from GitHub][github-app-link].

### Configuration

To configure the bot, you can create a configuration file:
`.github/header-checker-lint.yml`. The contents of this file define a JSON object
with the following options:

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|----- | ----------- | ---- | ------- |
| `allowedCopyrightHolders` | List of allowed copyright holders | `string[]` | `[]` |
| `allowedLicenses` | The allowed licenses. | `string[]` | `["Apache-2.0", "MIT", "BSD-3"]` |
| `ignoreFiles` | List of files to ignore. These values will be treated as path globs | `string[]` | `[]` |
| `sourceFileExtensions` | List of file extensions that will be treated as source files | `string[]` | `["ts", "js", "java"]` |

## Development

### Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

### Testing

This bot uses [nock][nock] for mocking requests
to GitHub, and [snap-shot-it][snap-shot-it] for capturing responses; This allows
updates to the API surface to be treated as a visual diff, rather than tediously
asserting against each field.

Running tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:snap
```
