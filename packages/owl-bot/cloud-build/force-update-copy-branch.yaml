# This is identical to ./update-copy-branch.yaml except for 2 differences:
# 1. It doesn't run the post-processor container.
# 2. It always creates a pull request.
#
# This build is designed to be run after repeated runs of
# update-copy-branch.yaml have failed.  The post processor must be
# throwing an error, and we need to present that error to the owners of
# the repository.  So, we open a pull request and let the post processor
# run on that pull request as normal.  The repository owners will see
# the error in the pull request.
