# GitHub has a 3000 file limit, when listing files modified by a diff, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/limits-for-viewing-content-and-diffs-in-a-repository#diff-limits
# for this reason, we use a clone of the repository to determine modified files:
steps:
  # Copy the GitHub PEM file from Secret Manager for OwlBot:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: [ '-c', "gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=owlbot_github_key --format='get(payload.data)' | tr '_-' '/+' | base64 -d > /private-key.pem" ]
  # main
  - name: 'gcr.io/repo-automation-bots/owlbot-cli'
    args:
      - scan-googleapis-gen-and-create-pull-requests
      - --pem-path
      - /private-key.pem
      - --app-id
      - ${_APP_ID}
      - --installation
      - ${_INSTALLATION}
      - --firestore-project
      - ${_FIRESTORE_PROJECT}
