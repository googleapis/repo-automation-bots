# conventional-commit-lint

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that lints commit messages based on conventionalcommits.org

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Configuration

The following configuration settings can be set by creating a
`.github/conventional-commit-lint.yaml` file:

| Name         | Description                        | Default              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| enabled      | Should commit linting be enabled?  | `boolean` = `true`   |

## Testing

This bot uses [nock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) for mocking requests
to GitHub, and [snap-shot-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snap-shot-it) for capturing
responses; This allows updates to the API surface to be treated as a visual diff,
rather than tediously asserting against each field.

Running tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:snap
```
