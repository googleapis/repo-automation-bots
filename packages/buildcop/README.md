# Buildcop

The Build Cop Bot manages issues for failing tests.

* If a test fails, the bot will open an issue for it.
* If a test passes, the bot will close the corresponding issue.
* If the test fails _again_, the bot will reopen the issue, mark it as flaky, then
  stop commenting and leave it up to a human to close.
* If someone closes the issue and the test fails _again_, the bot will reopen the
  issue and leave it up to a human to close again.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Install the bot on your repo. See https://github.com/apps/build-cop-bot/.
   Issues will not start being filed until you finish the rest of the steps.

   **Note**: if your repo is in `googleapis`, the bot is already installed.
1. Create `sponge_log.xml` xUnit XML files with your test results. There can be
   more than one, they can be in multiple directories, and the file names must
   end with `sponge_log.xml`.
1. If you're _not_ already using Trampoline, add the Trampoline `gfile`
   directory to your Kokoro job. This contains the `buildcop` binary that
   will be used to publish the logs.

   ```
   gfile_resources: "/bigstore/cloud-devrel-kokoro-resources/trampoline"
   ```
1. Call the `buildcop` binary for nightly/continuous tests you want issues
   filed for.

   ```bash
   if [[ $KOKORO_BUILD_ARTIFACTS_SUBDIR = *"continuous"* ]]; then
     chmod +x $KOKORO_GFILE_DIR/linux_amd64/buildcop
     $KOKORO_GFILE_DIR/linux_amd64/buildcop
   fi
   ```

   * The path can either be `linux_amd64/buildcop`, `darwin_amd64/buildcop`, or
     `windows_amd64/buildcop.exe`.

     File an issue and/or send a PR to update the `Makefile` if you need a
     different platform.
   * If your repo is not part of `googleapis` or `GoogleCloudPlatform`, you must
     set the `--installation_id` flag to the GitHub installation ID from step 1.
     If it is part of one of those orgs, you shouldn't need any flags.
1. Trigger a build and check the logs to make sure everything is working.

## Contributing

Instructions are provided in [googleapis/repo-automation-bots](https://github.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots/blob/master/README.md) for deploying and testing your bots.

This bot uses nock for mocking requests to GitHub, and snap-shot-it for capturing responses; This allows updates to the API surface to be treated as a visual diff, rather than tediously asserting against each field.

Running tests:

`npm run test`

To update snapshots:

`npm run test:snap`

If you have suggestions for how buildcop could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions.

### buildcop.go

This command is used to make it easy for people to send logs to the Build Cop
bot (see instructions above).

To build/run it locally, clone the repo, `cd` to this directory, and run:

```bash
go build
./buildcop -repo=my-org/my-repo -installation_id=123 -project=my-project
```

To deploy the script, run:

```bash
make upload
```

This compiles the binary for the various platforms and copies them to the
Trampoline GCS directory.
