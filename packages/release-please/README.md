## Testing

This bot uses [nock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) for mocking requests
to GitHub, and [snap-shot-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snap-shot-it) for
capturing responses; This allows updates to the API surface to be treated as a
visual diff, rather than tediously asserting against each field.

Running tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:snap
```
