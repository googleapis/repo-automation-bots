# generate-bot

> A command-line script that generates the scaffolding for a Github Probot application. 
> The script will generate a working probot application that listens to Issues and PRs.

## Generate a bot

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
$ npm run generate-bot
```

## Setup

The bot will ask you three questions: 

### What is the name of the program?
### What is the description of the program?
### This package will be saved in /packages/yourProgramName unless you specify another location and directory name here relative to ${pwd} :

You may only use alphabetical letters, hyphens, underscores, and spaces in your answers; otherwise, the bot will ask you to attempt to answer again. You must name your bot in order to continue successfully.

## Testing

Running tests:

```sh
npm test
```
