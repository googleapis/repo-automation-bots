# generate-bot

> A command-line script that generates the scaffolding for a Github Probot application. 
> The script will generate a working probot application that listens to Issues and PRs.

## Install dependencies

Run ```npm install``` at the packages/ directory level. 

## Run the bot

```npm run generate-bot```

## Setup

The bot will ask you three questions: 

### What is the name of the program?
### What is the description of the program?
### This package will be saved in /packages/yourProgramName unless you specify another location and directory name here relative to ${pwd} :

You may only use alphabetical letters, hyphens, underscores, and spaces in your answers; otherwise, the bot will ask you to attempt to answer again. You must name your bot in order to continue successfully.

## Testing

This bot uses [snap-shot-it][snap-shot-it] for capturing responses; This allows
updates to the API surface to be treated as a visual diff, rather than tediously
asserting against each field.

Running tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:snap
```

## Contributing
