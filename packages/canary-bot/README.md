# canary-bot

Instructions are provided in [googleapis/repo-automation-bots](https://github.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots/blob/master/README.md) for deploying and testing your bots.

This bot provides a testing ground for changes to other bots. Principally, it allows us to test and deploy changes to gcf-utils and other harness frameworks before deploying it to our bots.

The bot's only functionality is to respond to an issue in which the title includes 'canary-bot test' with the bots list of current dependencies.

## Running tests:

`npm test`
