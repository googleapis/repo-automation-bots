# trusted-contribution

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that will run Kokoro CI if the PR is created by a trusted contributor.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start

`.github/trusted-contribution.yml`. The contents of this file allow for the following
options:

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|----- | ----------- | ---- | ------- |
| `trustedContributors` | List of user login names that are considered trusted  | `string[]` | `['renovate-bot', 'release-please[bot]', 'gcf-merge-on-green[bot]']` |
| `annotations` | The list of annotation objects to leave the on the PR | `object` | `{ type: 'label'; text: 'kokoro:force-run' }` |
| `annotation.type` | Configure the bot to either comment on the PR or add a label | `comment`|`label` | `label` |
| `annotation.text` | The label text or comment text to be left on the PR | `string` | `kokoro:force-run`

## Testing

This bot uses [nock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nock) for mocking requests
to GitHub, and [snap-shot-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snap-shot-it) for capturing
responses; This allows updates to the API surface to be treated as a visual diff,
rather than tediously asserting against each field.

Running tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

To update snapshots:

```sh
npm run test:snap
```
