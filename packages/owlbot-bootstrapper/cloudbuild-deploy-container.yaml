# This build file will build and push the common-container in googleapis-bootstrapper
# to container registry. There will be a trigger in owlbot-bootstrapper that
# will build and push the image when any merges to main in repo-automation-bots occur.
# This will ensure that the common-container we call will stay up-to-date.
